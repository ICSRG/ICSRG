I am Halima Khatun, an undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering Student at Independent University, Bangladesh. particularly interested in machine learning and its possible real-world applications. 

My current research study investigates unique AI algorithms for detecting violence and creating safer environments. Through ethical and responsible behaviour, I hope to advance artificial intelligence and generate positive social change. My goal is to help build AI solutions that benefit communities and make the world a more equitable place. I am inspired by multidisciplinary research in computer vision and psychology to discover new methods for technology to assist humanity.
