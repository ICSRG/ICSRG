Medical image processing is a vital research area focused on analyzing and enhancing medical imaging data from modalities like MRI, CT, and Brillouin microscopy. It encompasses image enhancement, automated segmentation, feature extraction, and the integration of multimodal data such as imaging, genomics, and textual patient information. Leveraging AI-driven approaches, this research aims to develop innovative tools for accurate diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and therapy monitoring, advancing computer-aided diagnosis systems and improving patient care.
