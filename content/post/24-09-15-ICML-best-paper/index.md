Siam Tahsin Bhuiyan, an undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), is set to embark on a prestigious research exchange program at the University of Hyogo, Japan. He is working at ICSRG as a Undergraduate Research Assistant and is associated with multiple projects.

Starting September 2024, Siam will spend one academic year at the University of Hyogo, participating in research under the joint supervision of Professor Dr. Syoji Kobashi from the University of Hyogo and Associate Professor and Head of CSE at IUB Dr. Saadia Binte Alam. Supported by the Hyogo University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific (HUMAP) Scholarship, Siam’s will focus on Medical Image Analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Siam’s research will be on enhancing AI-driven techniques for analyzing medical images, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and healthcare outcomes. Specifically, he will work on developing AI tools to detect fractures from pelvic X-rays, aiming to create assistive technology for doctors.

Siam, who is currently in his 10th semester, chose CSE because of his affinity for science and technology. His role as a Research Assistant in Dr. Saadia’s lab since July 2023 played a key part in preparing him for this opportunity.

IUB and the Graduate School of Engineering at University of Hyogo signed an Academic Exchange Agreement in Autumn 2023 and Siam will be the second student to go on exchange following Nushrat Afroz Roza, also from IUB CSE department, who spent one year at Hyogo starting September 2023.

“I’m thrilled to work on AI-driven medical image analysis at the University of Hyogo. This research has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic capabilities and improve patient care, which is what excites me most about this opportunity,” Siam shares, discussing his enthusiasm for exploring new AI techniques and contributing to the future of medical imaging technology.

Siam is eager to embrace Japanese culture and adapt to the competitive academic environment. “I look forward to the challenges ahead and feel well-prepared thanks to the support and training I received at IUB,” he shares.

The HUMAP scholarship fully covers this mobility program, and provides 80,000 yen per month to the student as living expenses. The University of Hyogo, established in 2004, is known for its extensive research facilities and nine campuses across Hyogo Prefecture. It supports advanced studies with Japan's largest astronomical telescope and a synchrotron radiation facility.
